In today's digital world, ensuring the security of sensitive information is paramount. One of the first lines of defense in securing digital accounts and systems is the strength of the passwords used.
The "Password Complexity Checker" project aims to provide a simple yet effective tool to evaluate the strength of passwords based on various criteria.

Features:

Password Strength Assessment: The project will analyze passwords based on criteria such as length, presence of different character types (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, special characters),
and absence of common patterns or dictionary words.

User Interface: The project will include a user-friendly interface where users can input passwords to be evaluated. The interface will display the strength of the password along with suggestions for 
improvement if necessary.

Scalability: The project will be designed to handle large volumes of password evaluations efficiently, making it suitable for both personal and organizational use.

Customization: Users may have specific requirements for password strength based on their security policies or the systems they are using. The project will allow customization of the evaluation criteria
to accommodate these needs.

Security: Since the project deals with passwords, security is of utmost importance. The project will ensure that passwords are not stored or logged in any way and that all evaluations are performed securely.
